As he was drinking water, he suddenly saw a golden swan come out of the lake and perch on a stone. “Oh! A golden swan. I must capture it,“ thought the King. But as soon as he held his bow up, the swan disappeared. And the King heard a voice, “I am the Golden Swan. If you want to capture me, you must come to heaven.“ Surprised, the King said, “Please show me the way to heaven.“ “Do good deeds, serve your people and the messenger from heaven would come to fetch you to heaven,“ replied the voice.\nThe selfish King, eager to capture the Swan, tried doing some good deeds in his Kingdom. “Now, I suppose a messenger will come to take me to heaven,“ he thought. But, no messenger came. The King then disguised himself and went out into the street. There he tried helping an old man. But the old man became angry and said, “You need not try to help. I am in this miserable state because of out selfish King. He has done nothing for his people.“\nSuddenly, the King heard the golden swan’s voice, “Do good deeds and you will come to heaven.“ It dawned on the King that by doing selfish acts, he will not go to heaven.

Every year he would rebuild his palace and every time it looked better that before. “Marvelous! Unmatched!!“ the couriers would praise and the King would feel elated. One day the King thought, “This year, I will build the perfect palace, with all comforts. It should be praised not only within my kingdom, but also by the people of the neighboring states.“\nThe next day, the King worked out a perfect design for his perfect palace. After finalizing it, he handed it over to the builders and masons. In about a month, the perfect palace of the King’s dream was ready. The King invited noblemen of his kingdom, as well as the neighboring states, to get their opinions about the palace.\n“Unbelievable! Indeed, it is a perfect palace,“ cheered the noblemen in unison. But a saint standing in the corner was silent.\nThe King wondered why the saint was silent, when everyone was praising his palace. He walked up to the saint and said, “Please tell, O Saint, why you are silent. Is not my palace perfect?“\nThe Saint replied in a calm voice, “Dear King! Your palace is strong and will last forever. It is beautiful but not perfect, since the people living in it are mortals. They are not permanent. Your palace will live forever but not the people in it. That is why I am silent. Man is born with empty hands and so does he die.“\nThe King thanked the saint for his wise words and never tried to build a perfect palace again.","partsContent":"","questions":[{"question":"What kind of person was the King?","answers":["he was a bad King and and didn't care about his people","he was a good King and people liked him","he didn't like his people and they also didn't like him"],"correctAnswer":1},{"question":"What did the King decide to do?","answers":["he decided to build the perfect palace","he decided to give all his money to poor people","he decided to create a beautiful park in his kingdom"],"correctAnswer":0},{"question":"What did Saint say about King's palace?","answers":["the Saint said that the palace wasn't beautiful","the Saint said that the palace wasn't very strong","that Saint said that the palace was beautiful and would last forever"],"correctAnswer":2}]},{"name":"The Lion and the Mouse","content":"A Lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face.
